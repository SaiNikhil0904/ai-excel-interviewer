# **AI Excel Interviewer – Design and Implementation Strategy**

## **Introduction**

Hiring for Excel-related roles can be surprisingly tricky. You might think anyone who knows how to make a formula can handle the job, but in reality, there’s a wide spectrum of Excel skills – from simple sums to advanced functions, pivot tables, and scenario analysis. Companies face several challenges: interviews take time, assessments are inconsistent, and candidates often get different experiences depending on who interviews them.

To solve this, the idea emerged to build an AI agent that can conduct the interview by itself, simulating a human interviewer. This agent would ask questions, evaluate answers, give feedback, and produce a final performance summary. The goal is to make the interview process **fast, fair, adaptive, and consistent**, without needing human involvement at the first stage.

The approach is to build a **self-contained AI agent**. It doesn’t rely on a separate backend or database. Everything – the conversation, the question generation, the answer evaluation, and the report – happens inside the AI agent itself. The AI is both the interviewer and the evaluator.

## **The Idea Behind the Agent**

The idea started from a simple observation traditional Excel interviews are manual and static. We thought, what if an AI could step into the role of the interviewer? It should do more than just ask pre-written questions; it should **adapt**. If a candidate answers a basic question correctly, the AI should increase the difficulty. If the candidate struggles, it should offer easier or related questions to gauge their foundation.

The next step was to figure out how this AI would “think” like an interviewer. Human interviewers keep track of several things in their head: what question they just asked, whether the candidate answered it correctly, what the next question should be, and how to give feedback. We realized that an AI agent could do the same by keeping an internal memory of the conversation and by using tools to help it generate questions, evaluate answers, and summarize performance.

## **How the AI Agent Works**

The AI agent has three main roles:

1. **Asking Questions:** The agent generates questions dynamically. Each question depends on the candidate’s previous answers and the difficulty level. The AI doesn’t just pull from a static list; it uses context from the conversation to create new, relevant questions.

2. **Evaluating Answers:** After the candidate responds, the AI grades the answer. It determines whether the answer is correct, partially correct, or incorrect. It also provides feedback in clear, human-readable language and decides the next topic or difficulty for the following question.

3. **Summarizing the Interview:** At the end of the session, the AI produces a complete summary. It highlights the candidate’s strengths, areas where they need improvement, and overall performance in a professional report format.

The AI is designed to maintain a **memory of the conversation** internally. This memory tracks the current question number, the current topic, the difficulty level, questions already asked, and the candidate’s performance so far. This allows the AI to make decisions about what to ask next and how to give feedback, just like a human interviewer would.

## **Developer’s Perspective – Step by Step**

If you are a developer trying to implement this, here’s how you would approach it:

### **Step 1: Define the Agent Prompt**

Before any code, start with a clear **prompt for the AI**. This prompt acts as the AI’s “brain” instructions. It tells the AI:

* How to introduce itself to the candidate.
* How to ask questions and wait for responses.
* How to evaluate answers and provide feedback.
* How to update its internal state after each interaction.
* How to produce a summary at the end.

The prompt should be detailed. It should describe the internal variables the AI must track (question number, difficulty, topic, past answers) and explain how to use tools to generate questions, evaluate answers, and summarize the session.

Think of this as writing the script for the AI actor. The AI must follow this script but also adapt based on the candidate’s responses.

---

### **Step 2: Build the Tools (Skills)**

Even though there’s no backend, the AI agent uses **internal tools**. Each tool is a small “skill” that the agent calls when needed:

1. **Generate Question Tool:**
   This tool takes the current topic, difficulty, and previous questions and generates a new question. For example, if the previous question was about SUM formulas and the candidate answered correctly, the tool could generate a question about SUMIF or nested functions.

2. **Evaluate Answer Tool:**
   After the candidate answers, this tool grades it. It returns structured feedback: whether the answer was correct, partially correct, or incorrect. It also suggests the next topic and difficulty.

3. **Summarize Interview Tool:**
   When the session ends, this tool takes the entire conversation (questions and answers) and produces a final report in natural language. The summary should highlight strengths, weaknesses, and recommendations for improvement.

From a developer’s perspective, these tools are functions inside the AI agent. Each function is carefully crafted to take inputs, run logic (with the help of the AI LLM), and return structured outputs. They are not separate microservices; they live inside the agent.

---

### **Step 3: Implement the Agent Loop**

The agent’s main workflow is a loop that repeats until the interview ends:

1. Introduce itself and explain the process.
2. Call the **Generate Question Tool** to create the next question.
3. Present the question to the candidate.
4. Wait for the candidate’s response.
5. Call the **Evaluate Answer Tool** to grade the response and get feedback.
6. Update internal memory with the new state: current question number, difficulty, topic, and performance.
7. Give feedback to the candidate.
8. Repeat the loop until the interview finishes or the candidate requests to stop.
9. Call the **Summarize Interview Tool** to produce the final report.

For a developer, the key is **state management**. All variables must live inside the agent, and the AI must refer to them when generating questions or evaluating answers.

---

### **Step 4: Connecting to the Frontend**

Even without a backend, you need a way for candidates to interact with the AI. This can be done with a simple **chat interface** that talks directly to the AI agent:

* Candidate types a response.
* Frontend sends the message to the AI agent.
* AI processes the message using its internal loop and tools.
* AI returns feedback and/or the next question.
* Frontend displays the response to the candidate.

From a developer’s point of view, this could be as simple as a React app sending HTTP requests to the AI agent (if it’s hosted as a local service) or directly calling a function in memory if it’s running in the same environment.

---

### **Step 5: Handling Adaptive Difficulty**

One of the most important developer considerations is **adaptive questioning**. You need logic that decides the difficulty and topic of the next question based on:

* How the candidate answered the previous question.
* Whether the answer was fully correct, partially correct, or incorrect.
* What topics and questions have already been covered.

This logic lives inside the AI prompt and tools. When implementing, you have to clearly define:

* Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced difficulty levels.
* Topic categories (Formulas, Pivot Tables, Charts, Lookup Functions, etc.).
* Rules for moving between topics and difficulty levels.

---

### **Step 6: Generating the Final Report**

At the end of the interview, the agent must produce a **complete performance report**. This report should include:

* Summary of questions asked and candidate responses.
* Evaluation of each answer (correct/partially correct/incorrect).
* Strengths of the candidate.
* Weak areas and suggested practice.

The report should be **easy to read** and **professional**, suitable for HR review. From a developer perspective, you need to:

* Maintain a transcript of all interactions.
* Call the Summarize Interview Tool with this transcript.
* Format the result in markdown or plain text for display.

---

### **Step 7: Testing and Iteration**

Once the AI agent is implemented, testing is critical:

* Simulate candidate answers to see if the agent adapts correctly.
* Check if the feedback is meaningful and human-like.
* Ensure the final report is clear and actionable.
* Verify that questions do not repeat unnecessarily.
* Test edge cases, such as empty responses, wrong formats, or very long answers.

From a developer’s perspective, logging and debugging inside the agent is crucial. You want to see the **internal memory state** and the **tool outputs** for each turn to ensure correctness.

---

### **Step 8: Deployment Considerations**

Even though the agent is self-contained, it can be **hosted locally** or on a small server. Key points:

* The agent should run as a single process.
* All tools live inside the agent; no external dependencies other than the AI model.
* Candidate sessions are tracked in memory.
* Multiple concurrent sessions require careful memory management.
